# Version 0.0.8.900

The next version will have `handle_multiple="best_each"` which
will find the best match for each entry in a set of delimited
gene symbols. Most useful for something like pathway enrichment
results, where the goal is to retain all possible genes, yet
each gene may require a different type of annotation to
find a match. See `TODO.md` for details.

## Updates to existing functions

* `freshenGenes()` includes a new example showing how to recognize
Affymetrix probesets by using a custom search library.
* `freshenGenes()` handles multiple annotation libraries,
mostly in the form of fully described annotation names,
such as `"org.Hs.egSYMBOL"` and `"hgu133plus2ENTREZID"`.
* `freshenGenes()` new option `empty_rule="na"` which will
replace empty entries with `NA`. Other options `empty_rule="blank"`
replaces with `""`, and `empty_rule="original"` replaces empty
entries in the first output column with the original entry in
the first input column.
* `get_anno_db()` now returns``NULL` when an annotation is
not found, instead of throwing an error. This change allows
the calling function to skip missing annotation gracefully
without using `tryCatch()` to catch the error.

# Version 0.0.7.900

## Updates to existing functions

* `freshenGenes()` now properly ignores NA values without throwing
an exception. NA values are left as-is and returned as NA in the
final output.

# Version 0.0.6.900

## Updates to existing functions

* `freshenGenes()` new argument `protect_inline_sep` helps to
prevent splitting single values that may include the same sep
character, for example not splitting `"H4 clustered histone 10, pseudogene"`
into `"H4 clustered histone 10"` and "`pseudogene"`. Also, the
handling of `finalList` uses `sep` as the `split` since that `sep`
is known to have been used in creating the intermediate values,
therefore it should be consistent in the final step. This subtle
change helps allow a more general split pattern in the first
step, such as `"[, ]+"` which splits at comma and/or space,
without splitting at spaces in subsequent steps.

## New functions

* `lgsub()` is a simple wrapper around `gsub()` except that it
operates on character vectors inside a `list`. This function will
probably be moved into the `jamba` package in the near future.
In fact, there will probably be a small family of list-friendly
functions: lgrep(), lvigrep(), lvgrep(), lstrsplit().

# Version 0.0.5.900

## Updates to existing functions

* `get_anno_db()` was updated to handle reverse-map annotations,
for example requesting `org.Hs.egALIAS` and deriving it from
`org.Hs.egALIAS2EG` using `AnnotationDbi::revmap()`.

# Version 0.0.4.900

## Updates to existing functions

* Another update to resolve cascade `stringsAsFactors` bugs.
Least favorite default option in R.

# Version 0.0.3.900

## Updates to existing functions

* Force input `x` to character in `freshenGenes()`.

# Version 0.0.2.900

Note that genejam requires one Bioconductor annotation package,
usually `org.Hs.eg.db` but can be any valid organism, such
as `org.Mm.eg.db` for mouse, or `org.Rn.eg.db` for rat.

## Bug fixes

* Attempt to fix rare cases of NA values in `mget()`
by using `jamba::rmNA()`.
